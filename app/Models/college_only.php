// The system is for COLLEGE students only. This hides every other school level (Senior High, Junior High ...) WITHOUT deleting anything:
//   1. Students whose level is not COLLEGE are copied once into the table students_non_college_backup (a backup for the registrar to review).
//   2. Every non-COLLEGE level, with its courses and year levels, is deactivated (is_active = 0), so it can no longer be chosen anywhere.
//   3. "Form 138 / Report Card" (a high school document) is deactivated in the document catalog. Old requests that used it keep working.
// Nothing is dropped, truncated or moved. Safe to run many times. Needs the Academic Management tables (school_levels ...).
